# HackaGame - An Hackable Game Engine

**HackaGame** aims to be a *C* game engine based on multi-media library *RayLib* and MQTT library *Mosquito*, accordingly to [KISS](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principe_KISS)  (Keep It Stupid Simple) principle.
The main feature of this project is to model the world as a tabletop seen as a network of key positions (Nodes) on with 
interacting entities (Pieces) can be moved.
Players would be responsible for Piecesâ€™ behaviors and can be implemented in independent programs in any language of your choice.
In other terms, **HackaGame** implement a simple client/server architecture to permit player AI, developped on any language, to take a seat on a game.

**HackaGame** is seens as an API for game development.
Several games are proposed with the API for the example:

- **RISKY**: A turn-based strategic game where players control armies fighting for a territory.
- **HacKRPG**:

## Licence

**HackaGame** is distributed under the [MIT license](./LICENCE.md).

## Installation (Linux)

**HackaGame** work natively on Linux systems and commands is given regarding Ubuntu-like distribution.

### Dependencies:

C/C++ development tools, CMake, Test, [RayLib dependencies](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux) and ZeroMQ libs

```bash
sudo apt install -y \
  build-essential git cmake \
  libasound2-dev mesa-common-dev \
  libx11-dev libxi-dev xorg-dev \
  libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev \

```

### **HackaGame**

Clone then build the overall project.

```bash
git clone git@bitbucket.org:imt-mobisyst/hackagames.git
cd **HackaGame**
./bin/build.sh
```

## Getting started

The easiest way is to enter in one of the example games as [risky](./games/risky).
