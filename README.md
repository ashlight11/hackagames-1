# HackaGame - An Hackable Game Engine

**HackaGame** aims to be a *C* game engine based on multi-media library *RayLib* and MQTT library *Mosquito*, accordingly to [KISS](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principe_KISS)  (Keep It Stupid Simple) principle.
The main feature of this project is to model the world as a tabletop seen as a network of key positions (Nodes) on with 
interacting entities (Pieces) can be moved.
Players would be responsible for Piecesâ€™ behaviors and can be implemented in independent programs in any language of your choice.
In other terms, **HackaGame** implement a simple client/server architecture to permit player AI, developped on any language, to take a seat on a game.

**HackaGame** is seens as an API for game development.
Several games are proposed with the API for the example:

- **RISKY**: A turn-based strategic game where players control armies fighting for a territory.
- **HacKRPG**:
